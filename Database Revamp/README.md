## **Synopsis**: 
###   Our goal for Database Revamp is to provide and restore functionality to our client's database
###   through the forms they have provided us. This project establishes a homepage interface
###   that is straightforward to navigate. We've standardized our pages to follow a set
###   template, as well as provide our client with the necessary functionality they no longer
###   have.


## **Home Page**:
![Home Page](/src/homepage.png "Home Page")



## **Currently unimplemented features**:
### - Ability to Edit/View forms
### - Insertion into database (no available data yet)
### - Submitting forms

## **Example of one of our developed pages**:
![Product Page](/src/addproduct.png "Add Product Page")

## **Testing instructions**:
  1. To be established (no current data to test with, nor is backend up and functional)
## **Deployment instructions**:
  1. To be established (product is in the midst of being completed)
## **Developer instructions**:
 1. "npm start" in terminal (or "Run" in VSCode)
 2. Click buttons to access all pages
 3. Changes to your pages should be committed to our github repo
## **Timeline**:
### Phase 1 (finish by mid-Februrary):
 1. Create tables in database
 2. Test inputting data into database
 3. Determine roles/permissions for users in database
### Phase 2 (finish by mid-March):
 4. Connect our React app to Netbox
    - hosting our app so client can access
 5. Connect our front end to our backend 
    - consume and **save** completed forms
 6. Implement view/edit functions
 ### Phase 3 (additional features if time permits (to middle of May)):
 7. Develop ability to add fields
    - enable client to be self-sufficient
 8. Data analysis/trends
    - most common customers and trends in purchases
